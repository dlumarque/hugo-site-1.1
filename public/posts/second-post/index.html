After researching various options, I landed on Hugo—and it’s been a great experience so far.</p>
<p>One major reason is <strong>speed</strong>. Hugo is known for its impressive build times; it can generate a site with thousands of pages in seconds. Since it’s written in Go, Hugo compiles content almost instantly, which means I can make changes and see results immediately. This efficiency has kept my workflow smooth and fast, especially useful when making frequent updates or tweaks.</p>
<p>Another key factor is <strong>flexibility</strong>. Hugo supports extensive customization with its powerful templating system, so I can easily control the layout and design of my blog without hassle. It also has great support for Markdown, which keeps my content simple and readable while providing full formatting control.</p>
<p>Lastly, Hugo’s <strong>simplicity</strong> means I don’t have to worry about complicated server setups or databases. The static nature of the site also enhances security and improves loading times, creating a better experience for readers.</p>
<p>Overall, Hugo’s speed, flexibility, and simplicity made it a perfect choice for my blogging project. With a bit of customization, I’m able to get the exact look and functionality I want without sacrificing performance—making Hugo an ideal platform for any developer’s blog.</p>
