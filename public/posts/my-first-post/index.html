Today I acquainted myself with Hugo and the general
process of creating and publishing websites from
the command line.
How did we get here?

I was perusing other peers&rsquo; developer sites and portfolios, and found Ivan Renteria&rsquo;s site, which looked quite clean and generally pleasing to the eye. I liked the simple layout and easily organized way of presenting content.
Noted that the site was built with PaperMod, which is built on Hugo, which is one of many quick site building tools (perhaps similar to Jekyll but id-quite-k).

also branched my interest in relevant other languages/tools like YAML and TOML (and the differences between them)

YAML explainer video led me to dbt and Ansible as well
and a Docker explainer




And then the last bullet. is it auto updating even when i haven&rsquo;t quite saved the results? YES. fascinating.

My process looked like this:">
